1. The first example shows the goal scored by a player with the last name 'Bender'. The * says to list all the columns in the table - a shorter way of saying matchid, teamid, player, gtime
  Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'

Ans ==> SELECT matchid , player FROM goal  WHERE teamid = 'GER'


2. From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's scored a goal in game 1012. Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.
   Notice in the that the column matchid in the goal table corresponds to the id column in the game table. We can look up information about game 1012 by finding that row in the game table.
   Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012

Ans ==> SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2 FROM game where id = 1012


3. You can combine the two steps into a single query with a JOIN.
   Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.

Ans ==> SELECT player,teamid ,stadium ,mdate FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid) where teamid = 'GER'


4. Use the same JOIN as in the previous question.
   Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'

Ans==> select team1 , team2 , player from game join goal on (id = matchid) where player like 'Mario%'


5. The table eteam gives details of every national team including the coach. You can JOIN goal to eteam using the phrase goal JOIN eteam on teamid=id
   Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10

Ans ==> select player , teamid ,coach , gtime from goal join eteam on(teamid = id) where gtime<=10 


6. To JOIN game with eteam you could use either
game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id) or game JOIN eteam ON (team2=eteam.id)
Notice that because id is a column name in both game and eteam you must specify eteam.id instead of just id
List the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.

Ans ==> select mdate , teamname from game join eteam on team1=eteam.id where coach = 'Fernando Santos'


7. List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

Ans ==> select player from goal join game on matchid = id where stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw'


8. The example query shows all goals scored in the Germany-Greece quarterfinal.
   Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany.

Ans ==> select distinct(player) from goal join game on id = matchid where (team1='GER' or team2='GER') and teamid<> 'GER'


9. Show teamname and the total number of goals scored.
   COUNT and GROUP BY
Ans ==> SELECT teamname, count(teamid)
        FROM eteam JOIN goal ON id=teamid group by teamname


10. Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.
Ans ==> select stadium , count(matchid) from game join goal on id=matchid group by stadium
Submit SQL


11. For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.
Ans ==> select matchid , mdate ,count(teamid) from goal join game on id= matchid where team1= 'pol' or team2='pol' group by matchid, mdateL


12. For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'
Ans ==> select matchid , mdate, count(teamid) from game join goal on id = matchid where teamid = 'GER' group by matchid,mdate


13. List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.

Ans ==> SELECT mdate, team1, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1, team2,
    SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
    FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
    GROUP BY mdate,matchid,team1,team2;
